Diverse Observances"},{"type":"paragraph","id":"paragraph-722c16cd7d533b6d41c2f1fd2a36c9a5","content":"Yet if \\"Jim Lives,\\" as myriad graffiti around his tomb proclaim, it is also because Paris has now embraced him as a cult figure: his birthday has been marked by film showings, photo exhibitions, concerts, radio and television specials, even a poetry reading at the Georges Pompidou Center."},{"type":"paragraph","id":"paragraph-99a78fbb33439383a25f5438f488568f","content":"Morrison moved here five months before his death, fleeing scandals provoked by his raucous performances and apparently hoping that he would be recognized as a writer in a city where Hemingway and other expatriate American writers had prospered. But \\"the end\\" he so often sang about soon came."},{"type":"paragraph","id":"paragraph-39bcfc04692a854641546142fc8da08e","content":"Not all Parisians are happy that he is buried here. Families who own nearby tombs have long campaigned for his remains to be evicted, complaining that his fans smoke marijuana, drink beer and liquor and generally behave badly. Indeed, two years ago, the 20th anniversary of his death turned into a riot when guards tried to close the cemetery at night."},{"type":"paragraph","id":"paragraph-fabeb25f07e8b07740e0e95542e3c28f","content":"Since then, a guard is permanently stationed at Morrison''s grave, but messages continue to appear on surrounding tombs.

Now fans often carry their own busts or statues of Morrison to the grave as part of their tribute."},{"type":"paragraph","id":"paragraph-4b33e71bbf1b5dfe4c8c21acd724463a","content":"Fear of trouble brought extra security guards to the tomb today, but apart from discouraging beer drinking and keeping the crowds moving they had little to do. The visitors were in solemn mood, prefering to celebrate the creativity of the singer, poet and, to many, prophet rather than the violent self-destruction that marked his brief five years in the spotlight."},{"type":"paragraph","id":"paragraph-c2555c873a196b4f4f2bb1325b55a1f3","content":"Among the fans were few contemporaries, proof enough that he is far larger as a myth than he ever was as a star. Indeed, those at his grave today were almost all in their teens and 20''s, pilgrims who either were converted by older brothers and sisters or were led to Morrison by Oliver Stone''s movie \\"The Doors.\\""},{"type":"paragraph","id":"paragraph-969de715b61586f4b7aa0be1ecf722a2","content":"Yet what is the appeal of his almost-nihilistic message to this generation? \\"He''s not an example, but he''s a legend,\\" Florence Roger, a 14-year-old Parisian schoolgirl, said. \\"He wanted to die, to get close to death. Perhaps if he hadn''t been so drugged up, he wouldn''t have written such beautiful poetry.\\""},{"type":"paragraph","id":"paragraph-e2bf1e3a4d4e1eae6250902d5af681b6","content":"Rene Beuttkus, a 25-year-old who installs central heating for a living, drove with four friends from Dessau in eastern Germany to be here today. Why? \\"Because Jim gives another dimension to life,\\" he said. \\"It''s the words of his poems and his life.\\" Lyric Symbolism"},{"type":"paragraph","id":"paragraph-78342b2b07deb8da53b9a42fde74da19","content":"A tall, bearded Frenchman who refused to give his name said the message came from \\"up there.\\" And he tried to explain. \\"The song ''Riders on the Storm,'' is not about a motorbike,\\" he said, referring to a Doors hit. \\"It''s about seeing a light ahead and moving toward it.\\""},{"type":"paragraph","id":"paragraph-afd6d0cd6270cf6e61f5b37b240865af","content":"Christophe, a young Frenchman from Normandy, said he wished he had lived in the 1960''s. And for him, Morrison''s example was \\"to let things come the way they come.\\" Asked if that wasn''t passive, he said, \\"What else are we going to do when we''re unemployed and there''s nothing else in our lives?\\""},{"type":"paragraph","id":"paragraph-165fc962bc1362937ea37718c385c0d5","content":"He and a friend planned to spend the day at Pere-Lachaise.

Instead of Little League or Boy Scout camp, he spent his youth immersed in theatre, hanging out at his father’s rehearsals and performances. Young Spillman knew he wanted an artistic life — and even performed in operas as a kid — but struggled with his own identity and dark feelings of being an outsider amongst free spirits, only finding solace among his books. “I knew I wanted to be creative,” he says, “being surrounded by creative people all my life, but I didn’t feel creative. Growing up surrounded by musicians and people who were living for their art definitely shaped the way I look at the world.”"},{"type":"paragraph","id":"paragraph-af4da9530b0621640b55c81b5bc7aebe","content":"Spillman was, at the time of the Wall’s fall, back in the U.S. working as a freelance writer along with his new wife, fellow author Elissa Schappell. Questioning whether his idealized artistic life could include marriage and a steady job, he convinced Schappell to move to Germany, and that’s when All Tomorrow’s Parties becomes a Hunter S. Thompson-esque journey. Fuelled on absinthe from a Portuguese dive bar, the two eventually settle in East Berlin, a city still in limbo — as riot police battle with both skinheads and anarchist settlers. Laundromats don’t exist yet, soup kitchens double as bars, and the streets are filled with old furniture, abandoned for newly available Western goods."},{"type":"paragraph","id":"paragraph-48e38f24acd91a84fab449e615d4ff24","content":"Despite his journalist credentials, Spillman didn’t write about this unique experience at the time. “I had this delusional notion that if I didn’t write about it, it would keep going, the magic would not go away,” he says. “Not the most logical thought I had, but that was the feeling when I was there.” Spillman calls writing All Tomorrow’s Parties a “10-year odyssey” in which he tried to be as “honest and empathetic as possible.” He imagined his audience to be his teenage self, or someone struggling with the same internal battles."},{"type":"paragraph","id":"paragraph-d2b491d9161e45e05de77db2645cdc34","content":"“I was writing the book not necessarily for people I know, but for the lost people out there who are adrift now,” says Spillman. “When I was 16, 18, a book saved my life, reading other people’s narratives, either fiction or non-fiction was pivotal for me. It showed there was a greater world out there, and I wasn’t alone.”"},{"type":"paragraph","id":"paragraph-95d9a8f91f728ef0fcbdc86bad74126f","content":"Sue Carter is the editor of Quill & Quire."}]}',

The first 1,000 visitors to the Wall Museum received a small souvenir chunk from the concrete structure, a kitschy token of the 155-kilometre-long barrier that physically divided the city from its construction in 1961 to its eventual fall in 1989."}'
